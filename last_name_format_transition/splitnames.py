    Break a name into its constituent parts: First, von, Last, and Jr.

    :param Boolean strict_mode: whether to use strict mode

    :raises `customization.InvalidName`: If an invalid name is given and
                                         ``strict_mode = True``.

    In BibTeX, a name can be represented in any of three forms:
        * First von Last
        * von Last, First
        * von Last, Jr, First

    This function attempts to split a given name into its four parts. The
    returned dictionary has keys of ``first``, ``last``, ``von`` and ``jr``.
    Each value is a list of the words making up that part; this may be an empty
    list.  If the input has no non-whitespace characters, a blank dictionary is
    returned.

    It is capable of detecting some errors with the input name. If the
    ``strict_mode`` parameter is ``True``, which is the default, this results in
    a :class:`customization.InvalidName` exception being raised. If it is
    ``False``, the function continues, working around the error as best it can.
    The errors that can be detected are listed below along with the handling
    for non-strict mode:

        * Name finishes with a trailing comma: delete the comma
        * Too many parts (e.g., von Last, Jr, First, Error): merge extra parts
          into Last. The second part is merged into First if it is an initial.
        * Unterminated opening brace: add closing brace to end of input
        * Unmatched closing brace: add opening brace at start of word

    """
    # Modified from the bibtexparser.customization.splitname function to merge into Last instead of First.
